Summary: Scientists from academia and industry converge on Waterloo as the Perimeter Institute hosts Quantum Machine Learning.

The remarkable progress of machine learning algorithms in the last few years has not escaped the notice of physicists.  In fact, this community have been using techniques derived from machine learning for years, in research as far flung as materials science, quantum chemistry, and high-energy experiment.  Now, new developments are bringing the fields even closer together, particularly in the
